_You can get Premium nodes by buying a coins pack of 3$ or higher, check the_ [_Payment Guide_](https://discord.com/channels/884145104401608735/1348062654928912506)_. The payment is **not** monthly/yearly or similar, it's enough to buy a pack once to have the premium node lifetime. You can ask to get your servers moved to that node through a support ticket_
