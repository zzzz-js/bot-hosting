# The requested resource does not exist on this server

_Bot-hosting.net mainly offers 2 pages to allow you to host and manage your bots and they are the following:_

* Manage panel ([https://bot-hosting.net/panel/](https://bot-hosting.net/panel/))
* Control panel ([https://control.bot-hosting.net/](https://control.bot-hosting.net/))

The pages use **DIFFERENT** systems therefore, you need to login on both pages and you need to use the same account on both to see the same servers. The error you currently are experiencing is related to you not using the same account on both those pages and using an account which has no access to the server you are trying to access. To fix this issue please use the logout icon in the Control panel and login with the right account.
