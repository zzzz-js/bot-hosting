# Invalid Token has been provided / TOKEN\_INVALID

_You have an issue with your bot token in the code._

1. You have provided an invalid token in the code then you need to reset it in the Discord Developers website and paste it as new token in your code
2. You are not loading correctly the token. If you are using a `config.json` file for it, follow the discord.js guide for a guide on how to load that, if you are using a `.env` file, make sure that you are using the dotenv module correctly (check the package informations or contact their support)\

**This issue is totally unrelated to the hosting service and its something you must fix yourself. We cannot help you with that.**
