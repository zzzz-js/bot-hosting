# Cannot create server

You are probably here because you cannot create a new server on our free nodes. Some common errors are the following:

* `Creating server...` (stuck with this message)
* `Server Creation Timed out whilst in queue. Please try again.`
* `There is not currently enough capacity to deploy your server.`

All those issues are related to our free nodes being full. You have 2 ways to "fix" this issue:

1. Wait patiently, some servers might be deleted by any user or deleted after being suspended and you will be able to create new servers. This may happen from time to time and we cannot give any ETA (Estimate Time of Arrival) for when this will happen. **We also recommend you not to open new tickets about this issues, you will simply be redirected here and it will be closed.**
2. Buy a coins package which includes premium nodes access (3$ or higher) | [Premium Nodes & Support Information](../faq/premium-nodes-and-support.md) | [Payment Guide with Accepted payment methods](https://discord.com/channels/884145104401608735/1348062654928912506)

**Developers are already aware about these issues but there is not currently any plan for a new free node that we are aware of.**
